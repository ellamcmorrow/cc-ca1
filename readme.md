An investigation into how HSB colours blend together</br>
Introduction</br>
HSB stands for Hue, Saturation and Brightness. Hue represents 360 degrees in a colour wheel. </br>
Hue specifies the colour i.e red, green, yellow etc., hue ranges from 0 to 360, Saturation specifies the intensity of the colour it ranges</br> from 0 to 100 and Brightness specifies the luminosity of the colour and ranges from 0 to 100.</br>

The HSB model was derived from the colour wheel but differs as it uses a cylinder shape. This makes it more user-friendly when mixing</br> colours using digital programs. Isaac Newton created the first colour circle to illustrate how lights mix together c. 1665. </br>Newton experimented with light using the shape of a prism. </br>
Since Newton's publication, there have been numerous colour wheel concepts produced including Johan Wolfgaang von Goethe, he noticed the</br> essential role of magenta which is now present in most colour systems. </br>
Albert Munsell created a three-dimensional colour system in 1913. It specifies colours based on three value dimensions.</br>
Hue, Value and Chroma. The Chroma is similar to the saturation values in the HSB model, with lower Chroma being less saturated and a
higher chroma being more saturated. </br>
The Value is similar to the brightness value in the HSB model the smaller the value the lighter the colour.</br>
The colour wheel contains three categories of colours, primary, secondary and tertiary. </br>

Colour categories using the colour wheel</br>

Primary colours are yellow, blue and red. The traditional colour theory states that all other colours are derived from these three hues.</br>
Secondary colours include Green, orange and purple which are derived from mixing the three primary colours together.</br>
Tertiary colours are formed by mixing secondary colours together. They include red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green,</br> blue-violet and red-violet.


The basis of my idea involves exploring how the tertiary colours in the HSB wheel can be further mixed when a random hue value from 0,360</br> is picked and then blended with another random hue value from 0,360. </br>
Perlin noise was created in 1983 by Ken Perlin to create a smooth gradient of randomness that is organic to the user. Using Perlin noise to</br> produce a flow that will be aesthetically pleasing to the user and mimic the natural flow of light that is produced in real life. </br>
The idea then calls upon primitive shapes that will overlap making the blended colour more obvious to the user. The idea of using shape is</br> similar to the prism that Goethe and Newton used. A prism is a 3d shape, primitive shapes are 2d, therefore by overlapping the</br> shape in this case further dimension will be created.</br>
The colours of the rectangles will be representative of the spectrum of light these two scientists witnessed and will be more a lot more</br> diverse than a simple spectrum of light. Since the HSB mode will be used in the program the depth will also be indicative of the</br> cylindrical shape that the HSB colour model is based on.
